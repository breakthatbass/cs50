# Harvard CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

My solutions to the problem sets to the CS50 Harvard Course.
The course lectures and problem sets are available [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2019/fall/).

## Week 1: C

[```mario.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset1/mario.c) is a program that creates pyramids out of hashes based on the number the user inputs.

#### Usage:
```
$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
   #####  #####
  ######  ######
 #######  #######
########  ########
```

[```cash.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset1/cash.c) is a greedy algorithm program that determines the amount of coins needed to create change. 

```
$ ./cash
Change owed: 0.41
4
```
## Week 2: Arrays (C)
[```caesar.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset2/caesar.c) takes a number as an argument when running the program, prompts for a string, then adds the argument number to each letter in the string (based on its ASCII number) and returns it.

```
$ ./caesar 13
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: URYYB
```

[```vigenere.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset2/vigenere.c)

```
$ ./vigenere ABC
plaintext:  HELLO
ciphertext: HFNLP
```

## Week 3: Algorithms (C)
[```plurality.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset3/plurality.c)

```
$ ./plurality Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 4
Vote: Alice
Vote: Bob
Vote: Charlie
Vote: Alice
Alice
```

[```runoff.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset3/runoff.c)

```
./runoff Alice Bob Charlie
Number of voters: 5
Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Bob
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Alice
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Bob

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Charlie
Rank 3: Alice

Rank 1: Bob
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Charlie

Rank 1: Charlie
Rank 2: Alice
Rank 3: Bob

Alice
```

## Week 4: Memory (C)
[```filter.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/tree/master/pset4/filter) is software for applying filters to images. It provides grayscale, sepia, reverse, and blur filters which are all written in the [```helpers.c```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset4/filter/helpers.c).

#### Usage:
```
$ ./filter -g infile.bmp outfile.bmp
```
```
$ ./filter -s infile.bmp outfile.bmp
```
```
$ ./filter -r infile.bmp outfile.bmp
```
```
$ ./filter -b infile.bmp outfile.bmp
```

```recover.c``` - TODO

## Week 5: Data Structures (C)
TODO

## Week 6: Python üêç
[```mario.py```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset6/mario.py), [```cash.py```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset6/cash.py), [```caesar.py```](https://github.com/breakthatbass/cs50/blob/master/pset6/caesar.py) are Python versions of weeks one and two C programs.
